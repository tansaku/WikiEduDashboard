title: "Student learning outcome: Writing and communication"
summary:
content: |
  When something is missing on Wikipedia, it isn’t as simple as just correcting
  the error. A student weighs the evidence they have against the evidence
  presented, and works to communicate it factually, accurately, and without
  bias. They must carefully articulate their knowledge to do all this while it’s
  also understood by a lay audience.

  In the Wikipedia assignment, students build communication skills by:
  * identifying an audience beyond the instructor: Wikipedia's readers
  * focusing on topics appropriate to the course and discipline
  * giving and getting feedback through peer review
  * drafting, revising, and editing their work
  * engaging in formal communication processes to share ideas publicly
  * understanding ethical standards of writing to avoid plagiarism
