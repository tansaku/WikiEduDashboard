  Joining the Wiki Education Classroom Program means creating a course page on
  our Dashboard, a learning management system we've custom-built for the
  Wikipedia assignment.

  When you create a course page, the Dashboard suggests a template and timeline
  that breaks all necessary steps of a Wikipedia assignment into weekly tasks,
  training modules, and milestones. You can customize the timeline before
  submitting it for approval. During the term, students will follow the steps to
  learn how to edit Wikipedia without needing much time during lecture hours
  dedicated to technical details about Wikipedia. After all, Wikipedia is simply
  the tool students are using to learn about the course topic and develop new
  skills.

  The Dashboard is not just a tool for students. You'll use it to track
  progress, assess each part of the assignment, and view their contributions to
  Wikipedia. Wiki Education staff use the Dashboard to identify students on
  Wikipedia, monitor their drafts, and flag potential problems. In other words,
  we cannot support your students if they don't enroll on the Dashboard, which
  is why it's required to join our program.

  We'll review Dashboard features later in this orientation, right before you
  create your course page. For now, know the Dashboard operates as the central
  hub for your Wikipedia assignment.
