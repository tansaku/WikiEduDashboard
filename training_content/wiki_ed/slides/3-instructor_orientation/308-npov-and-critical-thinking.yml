title: "Student learning outcome: Critical thinking"
summary:
content: |
  Data analysis of students participating in Wiki Education's Classroom Program
  shows both students and instructors value Wikipedia assignments for teaching
  critical thinking skills more than traditional coursework.

  As students navigate Wikipedia's neutrality requirements, they cultivate these
  skills. They must:
  * determine which sources are most authoritative, considering publishers, format, date of publication, and author bias
  * weigh competing claims within the texts they read
  * integrate all claims without granting one viewpoint more weight within the article

  Students construct facts so readers can form their own judgment. By producing
  knowledge in this manner, they learn how to consume knowledge in the same way,
  thus developing critical thinking skills.
