  As the adage goes, on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog. That's why the
  Wikipedia community built a website where information is based on citations,
  not contributors' offline identities and accomplishments. Since this is an
  encyclopedia, articles should reflect the underlying literature and offer no
  forward-looking conclusions or speculation.

  Students are valuable additions to Wikipedia because they have context that
  helps shape their research process, and they have access to libraries full of
  published content. They should use that context to identify missing
  information on Wikipedia and then summarize the secondary literature they find
  in the library and online databases.

  It's not wrong to want students to learn how to present conclusions and
  recommendations, but that student learning outcome is incompatible with a
  Wikipedia assignment. If you're interested in teaching students how to present
  original research, we recommend adding an independent assignment to write an
  analytical paper.
